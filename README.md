# shortFormAudioSharing
social media for sharing short short form audio content. 

The main differentiator to this social media app is passive content intake. This app will impliment a simplistic UI that will allow its users to record short audio files and post them to a social feed. Along with simplifying the audio recording process, users will be able to listen to their peers through a feed of short audio posts. While the app will have the usuall scroll & select UI, users will also be able to passively listen to their feed like a podcast. Whether on their commute, or working at their desk, users can hear what is happening in the lives of their peers, all while their phone stays in their pocket.
